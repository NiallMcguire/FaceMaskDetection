# FaceMaskDetection
This was a short project to come to terms with the applications of tensorflow by training a model to detect face masks

#How to use
To run the file you must first have a version of tensorflow 1.15 or greater installed within a python evn as well as numpy. 
You must also have a suitable webcam connected to your system.

Once you have met these requirements you can run the custom_model.py file and present the camera with a face mask. 
  - Note -
  the model operates best with block coloured face masks that are layed out on a simple background or on a subjects face.
