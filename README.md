# FaceMaskDetection
This was a short project to come to terms with the applications of tensorflow by training a model to detect face masks

#How to use
To run the file you must first have a version of tensorflow 1.15 or greater installed within a python evn as well as numpy and openCV. 
You must also have a suitable webcam connected to your system. 

To Install these modules i would reccomend using anaconda and createing a virtual environment.
  - Note -
  Link to anaconda help sheet: https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/4.6.0/_downloads/52a95608c49671267e40c689e0bc00ca/conda-cheatsheet.pdf

Once you have met these requirements you can run the custom_model.py file and present the camera with a face mask. 
  - Note -
  the model operates best with block coloured face masks that are layed out on a simple background or on a subjects face.
